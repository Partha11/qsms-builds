## How to Purchase an SMS Package

Follow these steps within the QSMS app to buy your SMS credits:

- **Navigate to Purchase:** From the main dashboard, go to the Purchases screen. Here you will find a purchase icon at the bottom of the screen.
- **Browse Available Products:** You'll see a list of different SMS packages, each offering a specific quantity of SMS messages.
- **Review Unit SMS Price:** Every product offers a different unit SMS price. Larger packages typically come with a lower per-SMS cost, providing better value. Carefully review the unit price for each product before making your selection.
- **Select Your Desired Package:** Choose the package that best suits your campaign needs.
- **Proceed to Payment via QPay:** Follow the on-screen prompts to initiate the payment process through QPay. You'll be guided to select your preferred method (bKash, Nagad, or Rocket) and complete the transaction.
- **Confirmation:** Once your payment is successful, your purchased SMS credits will be added to your QSMS account balance almost instantly. If your dashboard is not updated within a few seconds, please contact our support team.

## Important Information Regarding Your Purchases

Please take note of the following details about SMS packages in QSMS:

- **No Validity Period:** For now, purchased SMS credits have no validity period. Your credits will remain in your account until used.
- **Pricing Subject to Change:** Product prices are subject to change anytime without further notice. We recommend checking the current pricing within the app before making a purchase.
- **Not Subscription-Based:** Our products are not subscription-based. This means that once the quantity of SMS messages in a package is exhausted, you'll need to purchase a new package to continue sending sms.
- **Balance Carry Forward:** Your remaining SMS balance will always carry forward when you purchase a new package.
- **New Package Unit Price Applies:** When you purchase a new package, the unit SMS price from the newly purchased package will be used for all subsequent sends until that package's quantity is depleted. This ensures you always benefit from the unit price of your latest purchase.
