# Getting Started with QSMS

Welcome to QSMS! This guide will walk you through the simple steps to download, install, and log into the QSMS application.

## Step 1: Download the QSMS App

QSMS is an Android application. You can download the latest version of the app as an APK file directly from our official GitHub releases page.

1.  **Go to the Releases Page:** Click the link below to visit the QSMS GitHub Releases page:
    [**Download QSMS APK**](https://github.com/Partha11/qsms-builds/releases)

2.  **Select the Latest Release:** On the releases page, find the latest version (usually at the top) and click on the `.apk` file under the "Assets" section to start the download.

Your browser or Android device might show a security warning, as you're downloading an app outside of the Google Play Store. This is normal. You may need to confirm that you wish to keep the file.

## Step 2: Install QSMS on Your Android Device

Once the APK file has finished downloading, you'll need to install it.

1.  **Enable Unknown Sources (if prompted):** Before installing, your Android device may require you to allow installations from "Unknown Sources" or "Install unknown apps" for your browser (e.g., Chrome) or file manager.
    * To do this, go to your device's **Settings** > **Apps & notifications** (or **Apps**) > **Special app access** > **Install unknown apps**. Find the app you used for downloading (e.g., Chrome, Files) and toggle on "Allow from this source." You may be directed here automatically when you try to open the APK.
2.  **Open the Downloaded APK:**
    * You can usually tap on the completed download notification in your phone's notification shade.
    * Alternatively, open your device's **File Manager** or **Downloads** app, navigate to your "Downloads" folder, and tap on the `app-release.apk` file.
3.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts:** Tap "Install" when prompted. The app will then install on your device.
